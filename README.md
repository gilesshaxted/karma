Karma - A Discord Moderation Bot
Author - BallisticEel

## Description
Karma is a powerful and intuitive Discord moderation bot designed to help server administrators and moderators maintain a safe and respectful community. With a suite of slash commands and an innovative emoji-based moderation system, Karma streamlines the process of managing user behavior, ensuring a positive environment for everyone.

# Key Features:

## Moderation System:

### Slash Commands:

* `/warn <user> <reason>`: Issues a warning to a user.
* `/timeout <duration> <user> <reason>`: Puts a user in timeout for a specified duration (default: 1 hour).
* `/kick <user> <reason>`: Removes a user from the server.
* `/ban <duration_or_forever> <user> <reason>`: Permanently or temporarily bans a user from the server.
* `/warnings <user>`: Lists a user's past warnings, paginated 10 at a time.
* `/warning <case_number>`: Shows detailed information for a specific warning by its case number.

### Emoji-Based Moderation:

* React to a message with ‚ö†Ô∏è (warning emoji) to warn the author and delete the message.
* React to a message with ‚è∞ (alarm clock emoji) to timeout the author for 1 hour and delete the message.
* React to a message with üë¢ (boot emoji) to kick the author and delete the message.

Automated Logging: All moderation actions are logged to a designated moderation log channel with detailed embeds, including case numbers. Deleted messages (especially those from kicks/bans) are logged to a separate message log channel.

Configurable Roles & Channels: Use the `/setup` command to easily configure moderator roles, admin roles, and logging channels directly within Discord.

Message Deletion on Kick/Ban: When a user is kicked or banned, their messages from the last 24 hours are automatically deleted and logged, helping to clean up disruptive content.

## Karma System:

The Karma system is designed to encourage positive interaction, activity, and contribution within the server. Users can build up a karma rating based on several factors:

* **Activity Bonus:**
    * **Active (20+ messages/day):** +1 Karma point daily.
    * **Hyper Active (100+ messages/day):** +2 Karma points daily.
* **Interaction Bonus:**
    * **Replies Received:** +1 Karma point for every 10 replies received to their messages.
    * **Reactions Received:** +1 Karma point for every 10 reactions added to their messages.
* **Positivity Encouragement:**
    * If replies to a user's messages are determined to be "mostly negative" (using AI sentiment analysis), those negative replies will **not** contribute to karma gain. This encourages positive and constructive communication.
* **Moderation Impact:**
    * Users who have received any moderation action (warn, timeout, kick, ban) within the last 24 hours will **not** gain karma during that period, encouraging good behavior.

### Karma Commands:

* `/karma <user>`: Shows the current karma points and daily activity stats for a specified user (or yourself if no user is provided).
* `/leaderboard`: Displays the top 10 users by karma points.

## Firestore Integration:

All bot configurations, moderation records, and user karma profiles are persistently stored in Google Firestore, organized under each guild's unique ID.

Karma is designed to be efficient, user-friendly, and highly effective in maintaining a healthy Discord server. It's the ultimate tool for a harmonious community!

# Setup Instructions

## Node.js:
Ensure you have Node.js installed (v16.x or higher recommended).

## Discord Bot Token & Application ID:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new application.
3. Navigate to "Bot" on the left sidebar.
4. Click "Add Bot" and then "Yes, do it!".
5. Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable `PRESENCE INTENT`, `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`, and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`.
6. Copy your bot's token. **Keep this token secret!**
7. Copy your Application ID (found under "General Information").

## Firebase Project:

Set up a Google Cloud project and enable Firestore.
**Crucially, ensure your Firestore security rules allow authenticated users to read and write to the following paths:**
* `/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/guilds/{guildId}/configs/settings`
* `/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/guilds/{guildId}/moderation_records/{recordId}`
* `/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/guilds/{guildId}/karma_users/{userId}`

Example rules:
```firestore
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write for guild configurations
    match /artifacts/default-app-id/public/data/guilds/{guildId}/configs/settings {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    // Allow read/write for moderation records
    match /artifacts/default-app-id/public/data/guilds/{guildId}/moderation_records/{recordId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    // Allow read/write for user karma profiles
    match /artifacts/default-app-id/public/data/guilds/{guildId}/karma_users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    // Default rule, usually more restrictive
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables:
When deploying, ensure the following environment variables are set:

* `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot's token.
* `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`: Your Discord bot's Application ID.
* `__app_id`: (Provided by Canvas/Render environment) The application ID for Firestore.
* `__initial_auth_token`: (Provided by Canvas/Render environment) A Firebase custom authentication token.
* `FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Your Firebase project's API Key.
* `FIREBASE_APP_ID`: Your Firebase project's App ID.
* `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`: Your Firebase project's Auth Domain.
* `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`: Your Firebase project's Messaging Sender ID.
* `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Firebase project's Project ID.
* `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`: Your Firebase project's Storage Bucket.
* `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: (Optional, for AI sentiment analysis) Your Google Cloud API Key if using Gemini API.

## Install Dependencies:
Open your terminal in the bot's root directory and run:

`npm install discord.js dotenv firebase express`

## Run the Bot:

`node index.js`

## Invite the Bot to Your Server:

1. In the Discord Developer Portal, go to "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator".

4. Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your server.

## Configure with /setup:
Once the bot is in your server, use the `/setup` command to configure moderator/admin roles and logging channels. This is crucial for the bot's functionality.
