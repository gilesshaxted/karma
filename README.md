**Description**<br/>
Karma is a powerful and intuitive Discord moderation bot designed to help server administrators and moderators maintain a safe and respectful community. With a suite of slash commands and an innovative emoji-based moderation system, Karma streamlines the process of managing user behavior, ensuring a positive environment for everyone.

# Key Features:<br/>
## Slash Commands:<br/>

/warn <user> <reason>: Issues a warning to a user.<br/>
/timeout <duration> <user> <reason>: Puts a user in timeout for a specified duration (default: 1 hour).<br/>
/kick <user> <reason>: Removes a user from the server.<br/>
/ban <duration_or_forever> <user> <reason>: Permanently or temporarily bans a user from the server.<br/>
<br/>
## Emoji-Based Moderation:<br/>
<br/>
React to a message with ‚ö†Ô∏è (warning emoji) to warn the author and delete the message.<br/>
React to a message with ‚è∞ (alarm clock emoji) to timeout the author for 1 hour and delete the message.<br/>
React to a message with üë¢ (boot emoji) to kick the author and delete the message.

Automated Logging: All moderation actions are logged to a designated moderation log channel with detailed embeds, including case numbers. Deleted messages (especially those from kicks/bans) are logged to a separate message log channel.

Configurable Roles & Channels: Use the /setup command to easily configure moderator roles, admin roles, and logging channels directly within Discord.

Message Deletion on Kick/Ban: When a user is kicked or banned, their messages from the last 24 hours are automatically deleted and logged, helping to clean up disruptive content.

Firestore Integration: All bot configurations (moderator/admin roles, logging channels, case numbers) are persistently stored in Google Firestore, ensuring data is saved across restarts and accessible from any host.

Karma is designed to be efficient, user-friendly, and highly effective in maintaining a healthy Discord server. It's the ultimate tool for a harmonious community!
